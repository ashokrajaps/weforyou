        <p>Thousands of children lack primary education in our country. Though Right to Education Act is in force there are many children who do not get proper education; the reasons behind this could be numerous such as financial condition of the family, child marriage, child labour, safety of the child and many more.</p>

        <p>Rural communities in India lack quality health care. Accessibility of doctors in rural areas is a major concern, people have to travel miles for hospitals and clinics.

            <p>Human activities are impacting Environment to a large extent. With rapid increase in industrialization and urbanization many environmental issues have come up like global warming, over utilization of natural resources, pollution, environmental degradation, ecological imbalance.
    For a sustainable development of the whole ecosystem it is very important that we take care of our environment. We would address these issues by conducting campaigns and educating the people mainly younger generations about the importance of environment protection and promoting green India.

    We as a team shall endorse gender equality, promote self help groups which will create opportunity for women and make them independent. Create awareness about importance of educating girl child.
