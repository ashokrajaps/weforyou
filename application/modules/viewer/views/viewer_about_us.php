										<h3>Founder History</h3>
										I was born in a under privileged family and was educated in a government school
										with midday meals and uniform that helped me to continue my education. Experiencing
										extreme poverty instoigated me to help other fellow being to bring them to the mainstream
										of the soceity while I was doing my dipolma.
										</p>
										<p>A Non governmental Organization came forward to give me sandals until then I have never wore sandals in my life.
										Their support enlightened me to start the Voluntary organization to give education to the unprevileged, marginalized,
										rejected in the soceity.
										</p>
										<p><h6>With all my friends and well wishers guidance and support we have cam forward and started "We For You" which is always serve for You.</h6><p>
										<p>We for you is a legally registered NGO in India run by group of people who are passionate to bring a change in the society. Our main focus is on environment , societyâ€™s upliftment and to bring overall transformation to the nation.  We believe that a NGO is not meant only to spend money for charitable works but also to leave long term and long lasting effect. We directly get into the root of the problem, understand the cause and effect and then find a solution, so that the problem faced by the people are addressed properly. We belief we can drive civic and as well as environment changes for the process of development. </p>
